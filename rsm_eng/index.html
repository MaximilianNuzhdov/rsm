        <h2>About myself:</h2>

        <p>Interests: By the age of 25 I have collected my book collection on a two-section cabinet (when I move, I think I will have to leave it), I play intelactul games like "What? Where? When?" (I even once was on TV, in "BrainRing" show), I prefer tea, not coffee.</p>        

        <p>I have always been interested in new knowledge. I love the challenges and learning experiences that arise when you try to solve them. At university, I learned to appreciate the quality knowledge and effort required to acquire it. In my master's degree, I defended a project called "Analysis of patterns of electroencephalograms using machine learning." This topic is very relevant at the moment, and in the process of work it was very interesting for me every time to find new works devoted to this topic, which brought me new ideas and new challenges. My scientific work taught me to keep my finger on the pulse and are not afraid to make changes to the original idea right in the course of work and study and always learn something new, not give up interesting new challenges. </p>

        <p>I am sure that with my skills I will be able to quickly enter the work process, and you can get a responsible and rapidly developing employee who is ready for new challenges and tasks. I worked in large and small teams in various fields. I am good at both following instructions and leading groups of employees or working alone. I have the right communication skills with clients.</p>

        <p>If I need to say about my cons I would point out that I do not have enough experience in the field in which I would like to develop further, but I compensate it with enthusiasm for learning new things and I can quickly adapt and join the team. Sociable, creative, I have a good reaction, a sense of tact and a sense of humor.</p>
        
        <p>Your company provides good start for new employees and I have heard some good reviews. I think that with your company I will get the opportunity for a good start and continue to improve myself as a specialist and I will be able to move up the career ladder, as well as acquire experienced mentors.</p>
